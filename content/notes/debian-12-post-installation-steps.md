This page covers the necessary steps after installing Debian 12.

In the following steps, we assume an initial system update has been
performed, either via Terminal or GNOME Software.

## Install Flakpak

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

## Install NVIDIA Proprietary Driver

By default, Debian 12 uses the graphics card integrated to the CPU. This
is usually enough for most GUI applications, but not for games and is a
waste of resource if a standalone NVIDIA graphics card is available.

To check which graphics card is used, go to `Settings --> About --> Graphics`.

To see if standalone graphics card is installed, run the following command.

```bash
lspci -nn | egrep -i "3d|display|vga"
```

If the outputs include something like below,

```txt
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GP107 [GeForce GTX 1050] [10de:1c81] (rev a1)
```

it means the GeForce 1050 Nvidia graphics card is installed.

The rest of this section assume that the machine is of `x86_64`
architecture and that the graphics card is GeForce 600 series or newer.

The installation process is essentially building and using a custom
Linux kernel module by ourselves. If the machine uses
[Secure Boot](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot), we need to either disable it
or sign the resulting kernel module by ourselves. Otherwise the GUI
desktop environment would not start properly. We can still login from
terminal by hitting `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F2` at the black screen with a flashing cursor though.

To disable Secure Boot, at the "GNU GRUB" bootloader menu page, go to "UEFI Settings".
Find "Secure Boot" and toggle it to disabled. See
[here](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot) for more details.

First add the following line to the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, which adds
the "contrib", "non-free" and "non-free-firmware" software repositories:

```txt
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ sid main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

Then install the `nvidia-driver` package with necessary firmware.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver firmware-misc-nonfree
```

This will build the `nvidia` kernel module for the OS, via the `nvidia-kernel-dkms` package.

Compared to `Fedora Akmods <Fedora_Akmods>`, Debian uses DKMS instead of its own tooling for building
kernel modules.

On Debian 12 with GNOME desktop and NVIDIA proprietary driver, it is
possible that X11 is still used as the Windowing System and we don't
get the Wayland option at the login screen. Follow all the steps in
[NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#Wayland](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#Wayland)
to enable the Wayland option. These steps do the following things:

- Enabling kernel modesetting with the NVIDIA driver.
- Installing the hibernate/suspend/resume helper scripts and enabling relevant `systemctl` services.
- Ensuring that the `PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations` NVIDIA module parameter is turned on.

On Fedora we use the `xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power` RPM package to install the hibernate/suspend/resume
helper scripts, while on Debian we download the scripts and install manually.


Finally, **restart the system** to load the new driver.

Afterwards, to check the status of the NVIDIA driver, run the following command.

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

To check the version number of NVIDIA driver as a kernel module, run the following.

```bash
modinfo -F version nvidia-current
```

## Install Software

### Dash-to-Dock

In GNOME Software, install the DEB version of "Tweaks" and "Extensions". Install "Dash-to-Dock" by:

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-dashtodock
```

Open the "Extensions" app and configure Dash-to-Dock settings.

### VS Code

VS Code is available as a DEB package in a Microsoft repository. We need
to install the repo and the signing key. Then the package `code` can be installed and
auto-updated as other packages via `apt`.

Install the repo and the signing key.

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget gpg
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg
```

Install the `code` package.

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code ## or code-insiders
```

### Firefox

First remove the Firefox that comes with the distro as a DEB package,
because its version is usually way behind the current stable release of Firefox.

```bash
sudo apt remove firefox-esr
```

Then install the Flathub version of Firefox in GNOME Software.

### Thunderbird

Install the Flathub version of Thunderbird in GNOME Software.

Perform `configure_thunderbird` to make Thunderbird run in Wayland native.

## Enable backports Repository

Open the `sources.list` file by:

```bash
sudo apt edit-sources
```

Append the following line to the bottom of the file:

```txt
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free
```

Update `apt` cache by:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

To find the backport version of a package:

```bash
sudo apt show <package-name> -a
```

There are two ways of installing a backport:

```bash
sudo apt install <package-name>/<release-name>-backports
sudo apt install <package-name>/<release-name>-backports dependency/<release-name>-backports
```

`<release-name>` is something like "bookwork".

The first installs the backport package while preferring dependencies
from stable. The second prefers dependencies from backports.

To list all installed backports:

```bash
sudo dpkg-query -W | grep '~bpo'
```

**Note**:

- Some package does not have backport versions, even if its Debian version
  is way behind its stable release, e.g. `pipx`.

- Do not install too many packages from the `backports.debian.org` archives. It
  may cause package dependency complications.
